# @hyperledger/hsc

This is a TypeScript API for communicating with a [Hyperledger Burrow](https://github.com/hyperledger/hsc) server, which implements the GRPC spec.

## Version compatibility

This lib's version is pegged to hsc's version on the minor. So @hyperledger/hsc at version X.Y.^ will work with hsc version X.Y.^ where ^ means latest patch version. The patch version numbering will not always correspond. If you are having difficulties getting this lib to work with a hsc release please first make sure you have the latest patch version of each.
